# Skin Condition Detection and Skincare Advice

This is a Streamlit-based web application for detecting various skin conditions from uploaded images using a YOLO model. The application provides tailored skincare advice, recommended products, and prevention tips for detected conditions.

## Features

- **Skin Condition Detection**: Detects common skin conditions like acne, wrinkles, dry skin, oily skin, eyebags, and more.
- **Skincare Advice**: Provides actionable advice, recommended products, and prevention tips for each detected condition.
- **Interactive UI**: Upload an image and view detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- **Supports YOLO Models**: Utilizes custom-trained YOLO models for skin condition detection.
